# Docker Course: Modules and Demo Code

Welcome to the repository for the **Docker in Two Days Course**. This repository contains all the source code and instructional materials for the course modules and demos. The course is designed to help you understand and apply Docker in real-world scenarios, focusing on containerization, image building, Docker Desktop, CI/CD pipelines, and more.

## Course Overview

This course is split into two full days, covering the following topics:

### **Day 1 (8 AM - 4 PM)**
1. **Introduction to Docker and Containers**
   - Overview of Docker, containers, and the Open Container Initiative (OCI) standards.
2. **Introduction to Docker Desktop**
   - Learn how to use Docker Desktop and understand its core components like Docker CLI, Compose, Kubernetes, and Buildkit.
3. **Docker Desktop - Developer Focused**
   - Explore inner and outer development loops, Docker Compose, and Kubernetes integration.
4. **Docker Security**
   - Discover best practices for securing Docker environments and Docker Desktop configurations.
5. **Image Deep Dive**
   - Understand how Docker images work, multi-stage builds, BuildKit, and image optimization techniques.

### **Day 2 (8 AM - 4 PM)**
1. **Best Practices**
   - Learn about governance, labeling, tagging, Docker Scout checks, and health checks for Docker containers and images.
2. **Compose and Testcontainers**
   - Work with Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications and explore Testcontainers for testing.
3. **Docker in CI/CD**
   - Integrate Docker into CI/CD pipelines, ensuring consistency and managing configuration drift across environments.
4. **Docker Networking**
